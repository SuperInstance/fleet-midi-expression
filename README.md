# fleet-midi-expression

_Expression and articulation — the soul between the notes._

_One of 16 ternary MIDI agents in the [Live Paradigm Fleet](https://github.com/SuperInstance/sailor-workspace)._

---

## Philosophy — Why Ternary?

The Live Paradigm treats musical gestures as ternary operations. Where binary logic
gives yes/no, ternary gives **approve/reject/observe** — a richer cognitive substrate
that maps naturally to music theory, emotional tension, and conversational flow.

This agent implements **ternary decomposition for expression**.

## Architecture

Position in the fleet pipeline:

```
🎤 Voice → OpenSMILE (25 features) → Ghost Track (T-0..T-4 CR predictions)
  → tminus-dispatcher (cue scheduling) → Fleet Conductor (routing)
  → expression (port 2165)
```

## API Reference

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /health | Health check + agent identity |
| POST | /agent with `{"type":"probe"}` | Liveness probe for fleet-conductor |
| POST | /agent | Process musical data, return ternary analysis |
| POST | / | Direct query with JSON body |

### Response Format

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "agent": "fleet-midi-expression",
  "port": 2165,
  "ternary_vector": [0, 0, 0],
  "ternary_invariant": 0,
  "closed_gesture": false
}
```

## Ternary Logic

| Position | +1 | 0 | -1 |
|----------|------|------|------|
| ternary[0] | intense/accented | neutral | soft/legato |

## Educational Supplement

Expression is what makes music feel human. The same notes, played with different
expression, can convey entirely different emotions.

### Ternary Expressiveness
- **Intense (+1)**: Strong attack, bright timbre, pushed dynamics
- **Neutral (0)**: Balanced, moderate, "default"
- **Soft (-1)**: Gentle attack, dark timbre, pulled back dynamics

This correlates directly with OpenSMILE's voice features: loudness maps to intensity,
spectral slope maps to brightness, jitter maps to tension.

## Fleet Integration

- **Port**: 2165
- **Roles**: cc
- **Conductor ID**: `expression`
- **Protocol**: HTTP POST to `/2165/agent` with JSON body, 5s timeout
- **Conservation Law**: Σ(Δ_midi) = 4 × Σ(ternary) — closed gestures return to start

## Starting

Local development:

```bash
python3 engine.py --port 2165
```

Or via the fleet start script:

```bash
./scripts/start-fleet-agents.sh
```
